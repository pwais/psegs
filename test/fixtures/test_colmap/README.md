The images in this directory were taken from:
https://github.com/pwais/psegs-ios-lidar-ext/tree/master/threeDScannerApp_data/charuco-test-fixture-lowres
The images were resized to reduce disk space use.

And Colmap was run (from this directory) using:
`colmap automatic_reconstructor --workspace_path . --image_path=./images/ --single_camera=1 --dense=0`
